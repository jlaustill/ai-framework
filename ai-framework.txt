A Framework for Thinking About AI’s Role in Modern Computing — (Data-Driven Draft)
Abstract

We present a practical, evidence-first framework for deciding when to use traditional deterministic software (the Deterministic Engine) and when to deploy modern generative / large-language models (the Probabilistic Engine). Rather than a collection of opinions, this document converts claims into testable hypotheses, ties those hypotheses to modern literature and production case studies (2020–2024/25), and prescribes experiments and telemetry to evaluate tradeoffs in accuracy, cost, latency, and failure severity. The result is a decision framework grounded in measurable outcomes and operational controls.

1. Introduction — from opinion to evidence

AI capability and product practice have advanced rapidly in the last five years. This progress is exciting, but it also means that engineering teams must measure where probabilistic systems add value and where deterministic systems remain essential. The goal of this paper is pragmatic: when we assert “AI is better for X,” we will attach (1) a hypothesis, (2) an experiment or measurement plan, and (3) the literature or case studies that motivate it (e.g., recent LLM reports, large-scale benchmarks, and production postmortems).

Why this matters: modern ML/LLM systems introduce new operational costs and failure modes that differ from traditional software. A data-driven approach replaces rhetoric with reproducible evidence.

2. Two Engines of Computing (revisited with evidence)
2.1 The Deterministic Engine (Traditional Code)

Characteristics (empirical):

Produces consistent outputs for the same inputs (determinism → reproducibility).

Easy to unit/integration test; errors are generally systematic and debuggable.

Best when even occasional incorrectness is catastrophic (financial calculations, compliance, core data pipelines).

Supporting literature: software engineering and ML systems engineering work emphasize that deterministic components are key for bounded correctness and for placing safety checks around more uncertain systems.

Hypothesis to test: On tasks requiring bit-exact transformations or strict validation, deterministic implementations will achieve near-perfect correctness and far lower catastrophic failure rates than LLM-based solutions.

Suggested metrics: absolute error rate, catastrophic failure rate, reproducibility (variance across runs), and test coverage.

2.2 The Probabilistic Engine (AI Models)

Characteristics (empirical):

Excels at interpreting ambiguous, unstructured inputs and generating human-like outputs (text, code suggestions, summaries).

Produces graded answers with uncertainty and occasionally hallucinations (unsupported assertions).

Can increase task success for fuzzy human tasks but introduces new classes of risk (hallucination, overconfidence, distributional brittleness).

Supporting literature: GPT-3/PaLM/GPT-4 and followups show strong few-/zero-shot capability; instruction tuning / RLHF improve alignment; Chain-of-Thought and sampling/aggregation methods improve reasoning but change variance/latency characteristics. Benchmarks such as TruthfulQA quantify hallucination and truthfulness.

Hypothesis to test: For human-language understanding tasks (intent extraction on messy inputs), an instruction-tuned LLM will achieve higher recall and higher end-to-end task success than a rule/grammar system but will have a higher rate of high-severity errors (e.g., misrouting, hallucinated facts).

Suggested metrics: precision/recall/F1, end-to-end task success rate, hallucination rate (annotated), failure severity taxonomy, inference cost per successful task.

3. The Fish and the Tree (metaphor + operational implication)

A fish is built to swim; climbing a tree is not its design. Likewise: AI is powerful in domains matching its statistical learning paradigm (language, freeform interpretation) and misaligned in domains requiring provable correctness. This is not a value judgement—it's a design principle that implies careful architecture and measurement.

Operational implication: For every AI use case adopt the Claim → Hypothesis → Experiment → Decision pattern before shipping to production.

4. Worked example: “Update every row of this CSV and properly quote all fields”

Plain observation (original): People ask an LLM to produce a script, and the model writes code — but the generated code can silently introduce subtle CSV bugs.

Data-driven rewrite:

Claim: “An LLM can produce a correct CSV-processing script.”

Hypothesis: When given diverse CSV edge cases (embedded newlines, quotes, variable encodings), a hand-coded deterministic parser will produce substantially fewer silent correctness failures than an LLM-generated one.

Method: Assemble a held-out dataset of 2,000 CSV files representing edge cases. Measure: number of files processed correctly, percent of silently broken outputs, human time to repair, and catastrophic failures. Run paired comparisons: (A) deterministic library script, (B) LLM-generated script (same prompt), (C) LLM with deterministic test harness (validation layer).

Decision rule: If LLM + validator equals deterministic script on core correctness and reduces human effort by >X% without increasing catastrophic failure, adopt LLM+validator. Otherwise keep deterministic solution.

Why this test is useful: it converts the intuitive worry (“LLM might silently break CSVs”) into measurable outcomes: silent failure rate and human repair cost.

5. Where each engine should be used — evidence blocks

For each pattern below I give a one-line hypothesis (to test), a short rationale grounded in the literature, and the primary metrics you should collect.

Deterministic: Data transformations, validations, compliance, database integrity, security boundaries.
Hypothesis: Deterministic solutions yield near-zero catastrophic failures on these tasks.
Metrics: catastrophic failure rate, regression frequency.

Probabilistic: Interpreting intent from messy text, summarization, creative generation, converting human requests to structured commands.
Hypothesis: LLMs improve end-to-end success on fuzzy tasks vs grammar-based systems when measured on human task completion.
Metrics: task success rate, human satisfaction, hallucination rate.

6. An evolving, evidence-based framework (process)

For each architectural decision:

Formulate hypothesis. (E.g., “LLM improves intent recall by ≥10% on our queries.”)

Design experiments. Choose datasets (production or synthetic), metrics, and significance tests. (Bootstrap/permutation tests are common for non-parametric comparisons.)

Run offline evaluation. Compare deterministic vs probabilistic approaches; when evaluating LLMs, consider deterministic verification layers or human-in-the-loop options and annotate hallucinations and high-severity errors.

Run pilot online / A/B test. Instrument fallbacks, latency, cost, and user satisfaction.

Decide using pre-registered thresholds. E.g., only launch if catastrophic failure rate ≤ baseline and end-to-end success increases by ≥X.

Operationalize: model cards, dataset cards, monitoring, human-in-the-loop thresholds, rollback playbooks.

Governance: Use Model Cards and Datasheets to document intended use, limitations, and evaluation. Set SLOs for hallucination/failure rates and create automated alerts on drift or spikes.

7. Closing thought (practical humility)

AI expands computing with enormous potential. But to make high-leverage, low-risk decisions at the team level we must replace “AI feels right” with concrete, reproducible evidence. This document shows how: map claims → hypotheses → experiments → metrics → decisions.
